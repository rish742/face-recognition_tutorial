# Steps to Build Face Recognition Project

## Step 1: Prepare Your Environment and Data

- Create project and data directories.
- Set up a virtual environment.
- Install necessary dependencies using pip.
- Create training and validation data directories.
- Organize training data into separate folders for each person.
- Prepare validation data with images containing known faces.

## Step 2: Load Training Data and Train Your Model

- Write code to load training data from directories.
- Train the face recognition model using loaded data.
- Generate encodings for known faces and save them to disk.

## Step 3: Recognize Unlabeled Faces

- Load saved encodings and unknown image.
- Detect faces in the unknown image and get their encodings.
- Compare encodings with known encodings to recognize faces.
- Display the results with bounding boxes and labels.

## Step 4: Display Results

- Use Pillow to draw bounding boxes on the input image.
- Add labels to the bounding boxes with recognized face names.
- Display the annotated image with recognized faces.

## Step 5: Validate Your Model

- Open validation images with known faces.
- Use the recognize_faces() function to identify faces in validation images.
- Compare the predicted labels with true labels to evaluate model performance.

## Step 6: Add Command-Line Arguments

- Use argparse to set up command-line arguments for different functionalities.
- Implement options for training, validation, and testing face recognition.

## Step 7: Perform Face Recognition

- Train the model with training data.
- Validate the model's performance with validation data.
- Perform face recognition on unknown images using command-line options.
